# PHP2650FinalProject
Final project for PHP2650 Statistical Learning and Big Data

Group member: Tabib Chowdhury and Zhejia Dong


## Overview

In this project we review of autoencoder, a powerful dimension reduction technique for dealing with the complexity of high-dimension data and extracting the most important features for analysis. We discussed several variations of autoencoders and compare autoencoder to another classic approach, PCA. We conduct two implementations of autoencoder: one for soccer data and one for facial images data to highlight the autoencoder's ability for dimension reduction.

## Code for Reproducibility

* `index.Rmd` and `index.html`: these two files are used to generate the github pages for public post
* `application_soccer`: implementation of autoencoder on soccer data
* `application_image`: implementation of autoencoder on facial image data
* `\figure`: folder to save two 3-Deminsion figures for PCA and autoencoder in soccer data
* `\Data`: folder to save all used data in *csv* or *RData* format
